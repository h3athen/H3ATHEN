 Its okay to dream big. Even I big dream and I am working in steps to accomplish that dream of mine 
 Coz Linus Torvalds once quoted : "Start Small And Think About The Details" and i think that at first
 it better to work with small things and be perfect at it than with work on bigger things and be nothing. 
 And later if we merge all those small things in a bigger cluster then we can frame 
 our dream even in a bigger picture.
 
 Fufu, I also enjoy watching anime and reading mangas. So if you are a weeb like me then HMU on the handles down below
